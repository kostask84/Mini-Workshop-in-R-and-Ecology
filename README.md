# Mini-Workshop-in-R-and-Ecology
A two-day seminar held in the Department of Biology of NKUA, introducing some basic concepts of Ecological Niche Modelling and Biogeography

## Day One
We will learn how to download raster data from directly within R-Studio, as well as how to crop, mask and aggregate these rasters. We will also become acquainted with some of the online species databases (e.g., [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/), [BIEN](http://bien.nceas.ucsb.edu/bien/), [VertNet](http://vertnet.org/) and [eBird](https://ebird.org/home)) and learn how to download species occurrences from these databases. Finally, we will analyse our species data with the [biomod2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biomod2/biomod2.pdf) r package and we will project our species to the future, in order to investigate the effects of climate change on its distribution.

## Day Two
We will talk about the several existing methods dealing with the delineation of the distinct biogeographical regions in the Japanese archipelago of the [Ryukyus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryukyu_Islands). More specifically, we will deal with the [betapart](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/betapart/betapart.pdf) and [rnetcarto](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnetcarto/rnetcarto.pdf) r packages and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.
